# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is an extension of JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML in a language other than HTML for the first time.

Researched answer: HTML is an essential language in web development. Code is typically either in HTML originally or compiles to it so that it becomes readable to browsers. JSX differs because it stands for JavaScript Syntax Extension or JavaScript XML as it is also referred to. JSX was created as to act as syntactic sugar for React.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager whicih developers uses to create React applications.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager that allows developers to share code with one another. Yarn stores the code that is refered to as a Package or a
Module, in addition to using a file called package.json to describe everything thats within a certain package.

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An Anonymous Function is a function that isn't correlated with a name.

Researched answer: An Anonymous Function is a function that doesn't have a name associated with it. It's usually the function keyword before a function name to define a function in JS. In anonymous functions, we use only the function word without the function name  in order to refer to the function as an anonymous function.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: "Props" is an object of data that a React function component accepts as the first argument while "State" is data that changes over the span of a specific instance of a React component.

Researched answer: In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly managed by the component. The state can be initiated by the component, rather than being synthesized by its parent.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: The DOM is the document object model and it displays the web page as a tree like diagram.

Researched answer: DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'. It is a organized representation of HTML in the webpage or application. It represents the entire UI(User Interface) of the web application as the tree data structure. In simple words, it is a structural representation of elements of a web application.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: Span and div are both HTML elements that group together similar code on a website.

Researched answer: Span and div are both basic HTML elements that complie related parts of a web page. However, they serve different functions - a span element is used for inline organization and styling, and a div element for block-level organization and layout.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: is programming which involves software design around data, or objects, as opposed to functions and logic.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic programming language which supports multiple programming protocols and was designed with an emphasis on productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types, and there are no strict rules for how data is stored.

3. Implicit return: If a function is returned values without using the return keyword, it's referred to as an implicit return.

4. Ruby blocks: A ruby block is one or more lines of code that you put inside the do and end keywords (or { and } for inline blocks). It allows you to group code into a standalone unit that you can use as a method argument.

5. Ruby hashes: In Ruby, Hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. Hash is like an Array, except the indexing is done with the help of arbitrary keys of any object type. In Hash, the order of returning keys by various iterators is arbitrary and will generally not be in the insertion order.
